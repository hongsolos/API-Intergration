## Background

The goal of this application is to help students track delays on bus routes 1, 26, 31, 36 
in real time in order to plan accordingly and make it to class on time. The user will be able to
see the planned routes on a Google maps plugin, in our case the 4 routes that we see have the
most issues, to see posts related to traffic, accidents, or the bus schedules on both twitter and
facebook, and contribute to these feeds themselves by posting straight from the application.
Using information we receive from multiple users will allow us to display the information in a
helpful and useful manner to see the goal through.

## Motivation

Thousands of A&M students rely on the campus buses to provide safe and timely
transportation to classes every day. In addition, there are hundreds of bus drivers who work to
ensure the students arrive in a timely manner and on time. Unfortunately it is a hard task to
monitor bus routes and be aware of any changes that happen in a moments notice.
Emily is deciding whether to get a ride with her roommate, or risk the uncertainty of bus
delays. Which option would be faster? She can hunt around on her A&M app, and look at
different news sites, as well as ask her friends if the bus is running well today. But by the time
she’s done all this, her roommate is gone and she’s missed the bus entirely. She catches the
next bus, but she didn’t leave early enough to account for an accident that delays the bus. Emily
is stuck on the bus and late for her exam. What if Emily had one place to check any available
information about bus delays? With Where the Hell is my Bus, Emily checks her phone quickly,
looks at the bus’s planned route, sees there is an accident right in her bus’s path, and decides
to either go with her roommate or leave extra early to make up for the delay.


### Usage Instruction

Contains in the docs folder is the pages of the websites that we implement the API on. Currently, it is offline due to GitHub's one page per account limitation. Fortunately, you can just launch from the HTML, all pages are linked and all code are commented in block for easy reading. Please only use this as a reference for your team project.
